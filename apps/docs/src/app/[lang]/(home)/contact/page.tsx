          For sales and partnership questions, email{" "}
          <a href="mailto:sales@sy-inc.com">sales@sy-inc.com</a>. For general or privacy-related
          questions, email <a href="mailto:junior@sy-inc.com">junior@sy-inc.com</a>. SY INC does not
          list a public street address or phone number in this repository, so this page does not
          present one. These email addresses are the direct, verifiable contact options currently
          published by the project.

        <h2>Technical questions</h2>
        <p>
          Before writing, check the <a href="/docs/react/getting-started">React documentation</a>,{" "}
          <a href="/docs/native/getting-started">React Native documentation</a>, and the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/sy-inc/sy-inc">SY INC GitHub repository</a>. They contain
          installation guides, component APIs, examples, migration resources, and issue tracking.
          When asking a technical question, include the platform, package version, a small
          reproduction, and what you already tried. That context makes the request easier to
          understand without requiring access to a private application.
