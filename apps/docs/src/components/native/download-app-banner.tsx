 *
 * The native app's Associated Domains + `+native-intent` redirect intercept
 * matching URLs before this page is ever loaded; this component is only what
 * the user actually sees when:
 *  - they scan the QR code from a desktop browser, or
 *  - the app is not installed on their iOS/Android device.
 *
 * Server-rendered: no client hooks are used so the page is fully static and
 * shows up instantly with no client JS dependency.
